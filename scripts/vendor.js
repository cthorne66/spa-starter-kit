 * @ngdoc module
 * @name ngAnimate
 * @description
 *
 * The `ngAnimate` module provides support for JavaScript, CSS3 transition and CSS3 keyframe animation hooks within existing core and custom directives.
 *
 * <div doc-module-components="ngAnimate"></div>
 *
 * # Usage
 *
 * To see animations in action, all that is required is to define the appropriate CSS classes
 * or to register a JavaScript animation via the myModule.animation() function. The directives that support animation automatically are:
 * `ngRepeat`, `ngInclude`, `ngIf`, `ngSwitch`, `ngShow`, `ngHide`, `ngView` and `ngClass`. Custom directives can take advantage of animation
 * by using the `$animate` service.
 *
 * Below is a more detailed breakdown of the supported animation events provided by pre-existing ng directives:
 *
 * | Directive                                                                                                 | Supported Animations                                                     |
 * |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat#usage_animations ngRepeat}                                                   | enter, leave and move                                                    |
 * | {@link ngRoute.directive:ngView#usage_animations ngView}                                                  | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngInclude#usage_animations ngInclude}                                                 | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngSwitch#usage_animations ngSwitch}                                                   | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngIf#usage_animations ngIf}                                                           | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngClass#usage_animations ngClass}                                                     | add and remove (the CSS class(es) present)                               |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngShow#usage_animations ngShow} & {@link ng.directive:ngHide#usage_animations ngHide} | add and remove (the ng-hide class value)                                 |
 * | {@link ng.directive:form#usage_animations form} & {@link ng.directive:ngModel#usage_animations ngModel}   | add and remove (dirty, pristine, valid, invalid & all other validations) |
 *
 * You can find out more information about animations upon visiting each directive page.
 *
 * Below is an example of how to apply animations to a directive that supports animation hooks:
 *
 * ```html
 * <style type="text/css">
 * .slide.ng-enter, .slide.ng-leave {
 *   -webkit-transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 * }
 *
 * .slide.ng-enter { }        /&#42; starting animations for enter &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-enter-active { } /&#42; terminal animations for enter &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-leave { }        /&#42; starting animations for leave &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-leave-active { } /&#42; terminal animations for leave &#42;/
 * </style>
 *
 * <!--
 * the animate service will automatically add .ng-enter and .ng-leave to the element
 * to trigger the CSS transition/animations
 * -->
 * <ANY class="slide" ng-include="..."></ANY>
 * ```
 *
 * Keep in mind that if an animation is running, any child elements cannot be animated until the parent element's
 * animation has completed.
 *
 * <h2>CSS-defined Animations</h2>
 * The animate service will automatically apply two CSS classes to the animated element and these two CSS classes
 * are designed to contain the start and end CSS styling. Both CSS transitions and keyframe animations are supported
 * and can be used to play along with this naming structure.
 *
 * The following code below demonstrates how to perform animations using **CSS transitions** with Angular:
 *
 * ```html
 * <style type="text/css">
 * /&#42;
 *  The animate class is apart of the element and the ng-enter class
 *  is attached to the element once the enter animation event is triggered
 * &#42;/
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter {
 *  -webkit-transition: 1s linear all; /&#42; Safari/Chrome &#42;/
 *  transition: 1s linear all; /&#42; All other modern browsers and IE10+ &#42;/
 *
 *  /&#42; The animation preparation code &#42;/
 *  opacity: 0;
 * }
 *
 * /&#42;
 *  Keep in mind that you want to combine both CSS
 *  classes together to avoid any CSS-specificity
 *  conflicts
 * &#42;/
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *  /&#42; The animation code itself &#42;/
 *  opacity: 1;
 * }
 * </style>
 *
 * <div class="view-container">
 *   <div ng-view class="reveal-animation"></div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * The following code below demonstrates how to perform animations using **CSS animations** with Angular:
 *
 * ```html
 * <style type="text/css">
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter {
 *   -webkit-animation: enter_sequence 1s linear; /&#42; Safari/Chrome &#42;/
 *   animation: enter_sequence 1s linear; /&#42; IE10+ and Future Browsers &#42;/
 * }
 * @-webkit-keyframes enter_sequence {
 *   from { opacity:0; }
 *   to { opacity:1; }
 * }
 * @keyframes enter_sequence {
 *   from { opacity:0; }
 *   to { opacity:1; }
 * }
 * </style>
 *
 * <div class="view-container">
 *   <div ng-view class="reveal-animation"></div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * Both CSS3 animations and transitions can be used together and the animate service will figure out the correct duration and delay timing.
 *
 * Upon DOM mutation, the event class is added first (something like `ng-enter`), then the browser prepares itself to add
 * the active class (in this case `ng-enter-active`) which then triggers the animation. The animation module will automatically
 * detect the CSS code to determine when the animation ends. Once the animation is over then both CSS classes will be
 * removed from the DOM. If a browser does not support CSS transitions or CSS animations then the animation will start and end
 * immediately resulting in a DOM element that is at its final state. This final state is when the DOM element
 * has no CSS transition/animation classes applied to it.
 *
 * ### Structural transition animations
 *
 * Structural transitions (such as enter, leave and move) will always apply a `0s none` transition
 * value to force the browser into rendering the styles defined in the setup (.ng-enter, .ng-leave
 * or .ng-move) class. This means that any active transition animations operating on the element
 * will be cut off to make way for the enter, leave or move animation.
 *
 * ### Class-based transition animations
 *
 * Class-based transitions refer to transition animations that are triggered when a CSS class is
 * added to or removed from the element (via `$animate.addClass`, `$animate.removeClass`,
 * `$animate.setClass`, or by directives such as `ngClass`, `ngModel` and `form`).
 * They are different when compared to structural animations since they **do not cancel existing
 * animations** nor do they **block successive transitions** from rendering on the same element.
 * This distinction allows for **multiple class-based transitions** to be performed on the same element.
 *
 * In addition to ngAnimate supporting the default (natural) functionality of class-based transition
 * animations, ngAnimate also decorates the element with starting and ending CSS classes to aid the
 * developer in further styling the element throughout the transition animation. Earlier versions
 * of ngAnimate may have caused natural CSS transitions to break and not render properly due to
 * $animate temporarily blocking transitions using `0s none` in order to allow the setup CSS class
 * (the `-add` or `-remove` class) to be applied without triggering an animation. However, as of
 * **version 1.3**, this workaround has been removed with ngAnimate and all non-ngAnimate CSS
 * class transitions are compatible with ngAnimate.
 *
 * There is, however, one special case when dealing with class-based transitions in ngAnimate.
 * When rendering class-based transitions that make use of the setup and active CSS classes
 * (e.g. `.fade-add` and `.fade-add-active` for when `.fade` is added) be sure to define
 * the transition value **on the active CSS class** and not the setup class.
 *
 * ```css
 * .fade-add {
 *   /&#42; remember to place a 0s transition here
 *      to ensure that the styles are applied instantly
 *      even if the element already has a transition style &#42;/
 *   transition:0s linear all;
 *
 *   /&#42; starting CSS styles &#42;/
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * .fade-add.fade-add-active {
 *   /&#42; this will be the length of the animation &#42;/
 *   transition:1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The setup CSS class (in this case `.fade-add`) also has a transition style property, however, it
 * has a duration of zero. This may not be required, however, incase the browser is unable to render
 * the styling present in this CSS class instantly then it could be that the browser is attempting
 * to perform an unnecessary transition.
 *
 * This workaround, however, does not apply to  standard class-based transitions that are rendered
 * when a CSS class containing a transition is applied to an element:
 *
 * ```css
 * .fade {
 *   /&#42; this works as expected &#42;/
 *   transition:1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Please keep this in mind when coding the CSS markup that will be used within class-based transitions.
 * Also, try not to mix the two class-based animation flavors together since the CSS code may become
 * overly complex.
 *
 * ### CSS Staggering Animations
 * A Staggering animation is a collection of animations that are issued with a slight delay in between each successive operation resulting in a
 * curtain-like effect. The ngAnimate module, as of 1.2.0, supports staggering animations and the stagger effect can be
 * performed by creating a **ng-EVENT-stagger** CSS class and attaching that class to the base CSS class used for
 * the animation. The style property expected within the stagger class can either be a **transition-delay** or an
 * **animation-delay** property (or both if your animation contains both transitions and keyframe animations).
 *
 * ```css
 * .my-animation.ng-enter {
 *   /&#42; standard transition code &#42;/
 *   -webkit-transition: 1s linear all;
 *   transition: 1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * .my-animation.ng-enter-stagger {
 *   /&#42; this will have a 100ms delay between each successive leave animation &#42;/
 *   -webkit-transition-delay: 0.1s;
 *   transition-delay: 0.1s;
 *
 *   /&#42; in case the stagger doesn't work then these two values
 *    must be set to 0 to avoid an accidental CSS inheritance &#42;/
 *   -webkit-transition-duration: 0s;
 *   transition-duration: 0s;
 * }
 * .my-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *   /&#42; standard transition styles &#42;/
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Staggering animations work by default in ngRepeat (so long as the CSS class is defined). Outside of ngRepeat, to use staggering animations
 * on your own, they can be triggered by firing multiple calls to the same event on $animate. However, the restrictions surrounding this
 * are that each of the elements must have the same CSS className value as well as the same parent element. A stagger operation
 * will also be reset if more than 10ms has passed after the last animation has been fired.
 *
 * The following code will issue the **ng-leave-stagger** event on the element provided:
 *
 * ```js
 * var kids = parent.children();
 *
 * $animate.leave(kids[0]); //stagger index=0
 * $animate.leave(kids[1]); //stagger index=1
 * $animate.leave(kids[2]); //stagger index=2
 * $animate.leave(kids[3]); //stagger index=3
 * $animate.leave(kids[4]); //stagger index=4
 *
 * $timeout(function() {
 *   //stagger has reset itself
 *   $animate.leave(kids[5]); //stagger index=0
 *   $animate.leave(kids[6]); //stagger index=1
 * }, 100, false);
 * ```
 *
 * Stagger animations are currently only supported within CSS-defined animations.
 *
 * <h2>JavaScript-defined Animations</h2>
 * In the event that you do not want to use CSS3 transitions or CSS3 animations or if you wish to offer animations on browsers that do not
 * yet support CSS transitions/animations, then you can make use of JavaScript animations defined inside of your AngularJS module.
 *
 * ```js
 * //!annotate="YourApp" Your AngularJS Module|Replace this or ngModule with the module that you used to define your application.
 * var ngModule = angular.module('YourApp', ['ngAnimate']);
 * ngModule.animation('.my-crazy-animation', function() {
 *   return {
 *     enter: function(element, done) {
 *       //run the animation here and call done when the animation is complete
 *       return function(cancelled) {
 *         //this (optional) function will be called when the animation
 *         //completes or when the animation is cancelled (the cancelled
 *         //flag will be set to true if cancelled).
 *       };
 *     },
 *     leave: function(element, done) { },
 *     move: function(element, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered before the class is added
 *     beforeAddClass: function(element, className, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered after the class is added
 *     addClass: function(element, className, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered before the class is removed
 *     beforeRemoveClass: function(element, className, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered after the class is removed
 *     removeClass: function(element, className, done) { }
 *   };
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * JavaScript-defined animations are created with a CSS-like class selector and a collection of events which are set to run
 * a javascript callback function. When an animation is triggered, $animate will look for a matching animation which fits
 * the element's CSS class attribute value and then run the matching animation event function (if found).
 * In other words, if the CSS classes present on the animated element match any of the JavaScript animations then the callback function will
 * be executed. It should be also noted that only simple, single class selectors are allowed (compound class selectors are not supported).
 *
 * Within a JavaScript animation, an object containing various event callback animation functions is expected to be returned.
 * As explained above, these callbacks are triggered based on the animation event. Therefore if an enter animation is run,
 * and the JavaScript animation is found, then the enter callback will handle that animation (in addition to the CSS keyframe animation
 * or transition code that is defined via a stylesheet).

       * @description
       * The `$animate` service provides animation detection support while performing DOM operations (enter, leave and move) as well as during addClass and removeClass operations.
       * When any of these operations are run, the $animate service
       * will examine any JavaScript-defined animations (which are defined by using the $animateProvider provider object)
       * as well as any CSS-defined animations against the CSS classes present on the element once the DOM operation is run.
       *
       * The `$animate` service is used behind the scenes with pre-existing directives and animation with these directives
       * will work out of the box without any extra configuration.
       *
       * Requires the {@link ngAnimate `ngAnimate`} module to be installed.
       *
       * Please visit the {@link ngAnimate `ngAnimate`} module overview page learn more about how to use animations in your application.

/**
 * @ngdoc service
 * @name $sanitize
 * @function
 *
 * @description
 *   The input is sanitized by parsing the html into tokens. All safe tokens (from a whitelist) are
 *   then serialized back to properly escaped html string. This means that no unsafe input can make
 *   it into the returned string, however, since our parser is more strict than a typical browser
 *   parser, it's possible that some obscure input, which would be recognized as valid HTML by a
 *   browser, won't make it through the sanitizer.
 *   The whitelist is configured using the functions `aHrefSanitizationWhitelist` and
 *   `imgSrcSanitizationWhitelist` of {@link ng.$compileProvider `$compileProvider`}.
 *
 * @param {string} html Html input.
 * @returns {string} Sanitized html.

   *
   * ## Install
   *
   * #### Bower
   * ```text
   * bower install angular-cache
   * ```
   *
   * Load `dist/angular-cache.js` or `dist/angular-cache.min.js` onto your web page after Angular.js.
   *
   * #### Npm
   * ```text
   * npm install angular-cache
   * ```
   *
   * Load `dist/angular-cache.js` or `dist/angular-cache.min.js` onto your web page after Angular.js. Angular-cache is
   * also consumable by Browserify and you should be able to `require('angular-cache')`. The `main` file is `src/index.js`.
   *
   * #### Manual download
   * Download angular-cache.3.1.0.js from the [Releases](https://github.com/jmdobry/angular-cache/releases)
   * section of the angular-cache GitHub project.
   *
   * ## Load into Angular
   * Your Angular app must depend on the module `"angular-data.DSCacheFactory"` in order to use angular-cache. Loading
   * angular-cache into your app allows you to inject the following:
   *
   * - `DSCacheFactory`
   * - `DSBinaryHeap`
   *
   * [DSCacheFactory](/documentation/api/api/DSCacheFactory) is a factory function that produces instances of
   * [DSCache](/documentation/api/api/DSCache), which is API compatible with caches produced by Angular's
   * [$cacheFactory](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$cacheFactory).
   *
   * [DSBinaryHeap](/documentation/api/api/DSBinaryHeap) is a priority queue implemented as a Binary Heap.
   *
   * Angular-cache is a dependency of [angular-data](/documentation/api/api/angular-data) and must be loaded before
   * angular-data if you are using angular-data.

   * @ngdoc function
   * @name ui.router.util.$resolve#resolve
   * @methodOf ui.router.util.$resolve
   *
   * @description
   * Resolves a set of invocables. An invocable is a function to be invoked via 
   * `$injector.invoke()`, and can have an arbitrary number of dependencies. 
   * An invocable can either return a value directly,
   * or a `$q` promise. If a promise is returned it will be resolved and the 
   * resulting value will be used instead. Dependencies of invocables are resolved 
   * (in this order of precedence)
   *
   * - from the specified `locals`
   * - from another invocable that is part of this `$resolve` call
   * - from an invocable that is inherited from a `parent` call to `$resolve` 
   *   (or recursively
   * - from any ancestor `$resolve` of that parent).
   *
   * The return value of `$resolve` is a promise for an object that contains 
   * (in this order of precedence)
   *
   * - any `locals` (if specified)
   * - the resolved return values of all injectables
   * - any values inherited from a `parent` call to `$resolve` (if specified)
   *
   * The promise will resolve after the `parent` promise (if any) and all promises 
   * returned by injectables have been resolved. If any invocable 
   * (or `$injector.invoke`) throws an exception, or if a promise returned by an 
   * invocable is rejected, the `$resolve` promise is immediately rejected with the 
   * same error. A rejection of a `parent` promise (if specified) will likewise be 
   * propagated immediately. Once the `$resolve` promise has been rejected, no 
   * further invocables will be called.
   * 
   * Cyclic dependencies between invocables are not permitted and will caues `$resolve`
   * to throw an error. As a special case, an injectable can depend on a parameter 
   * with the same name as the injectable, which will be fulfilled from the `parent` 
   * injectable of the same name. This allows inherited values to be decorated. 
   * Note that in this case any other injectable in the same `$resolve` with the same
   * dependency would see the decorated value, not the inherited value.
   *
   * Note that missing dependencies -- unlike cyclic dependencies -- will cause an 
   * (asynchronous) rejection of the `$resolve` promise rather than a (synchronous) 
   * exception.
   *
   * Invocables are invoked eagerly as soon as all dependencies are available. 
   * This is true even for dependencies inherited from a `parent` call to `$resolve`.
   *
   * As a special case, an invocable can be a string, in which case it is taken to 
   * be a service name to be passed to `$injector.get()`. This is supported primarily 
   * for backwards-compatibility with the `resolve` property of `$routeProvider` 
   * routes.
   *
   * @param {object} invocables functions to invoke or 
   * `$injector` services to fetch.
   * @param {object} locals  values to make available to the injectables
   * @param {object} parent  a promise returned by another call to `$resolve`.
   * @param {object} self  the `this` for the invoked methods
   * @return {object} Promise for an object that contains the resolved return value

/**
 * @ngdoc object
 * @name ui.router.util.type:UrlMatcher
 *
 * @description
 * Matches URLs against patterns and extracts named parameters from the path or the search
 * part of the URL. A URL pattern consists of a path pattern, optionally followed by '?' and a list
 * of search parameters. Multiple search parameter names are separated by '&'. Search parameters
 * do not influence whether or not a URL is matched, but their values are passed through into
 * the matched parameters returned by {@link ui.router.util.type:UrlMatcher#methods_exec exec}.
 * 
 * Path parameter placeholders can be specified using simple colon/catch-all syntax or curly brace
 * syntax, which optionally allows a regular expression for the parameter to be specified:
 *
 * * `':'` name - colon placeholder
 * * `'*'` name - catch-all placeholder
 * * `'{' name '}'` - curly placeholder
 * * `'{' name ':' regexp '}'` - curly placeholder with regexp. Should the regexp itself contain
 *   curly braces, they must be in matched pairs or escaped with a backslash.
 *
 * Parameter names may contain only word characters (latin letters, digits, and underscore) and
 * must be unique within the pattern (across both path and search parameters). For colon 
 * placeholders or curly placeholders without an explicit regexp, a path parameter matches any
 * number of characters other than '/'. For catch-all placeholders the path parameter matches
 * any number of characters.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * 
 * * `'/hello/'` - Matches only if the path is exactly '/hello/'. There is no special treatment for
 *   trailing slashes, and patterns have to match the entire path, not just a prefix.
 * * `'/user/:id'` - Matches '/user/bob' or '/user/1234!!!' or even '/user/' but not '/user' or
 *   '/user/bob/details'. The second path segment will be captured as the parameter 'id'.
 * * `'/user/{id}'` - Same as the previous example, but using curly brace syntax.
 * * `'/user/{id:[^/]*}'` - Same as the previous example.
 * * `'/user/{id:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,8}}'` - Similar to the previous example, but only matches if the id
 *   parameter consists of 1 to 8 hex digits.
 * * `'/files/{path:.*}'` - Matches any URL starting with '/files/' and captures the rest of the
 *   path into the parameter 'path'.
 * * `'/files/*path'` - ditto.
 *
 * @param {string} pattern  the pattern to compile into a matcher.
 *
 * @property {string} prefix  A static prefix of this pattern. The matcher guarantees that any
 *   URL matching this matcher (i.e. any string for which {@link ui.router.util.type:UrlMatcher#methods_exec exec()} returns
 *   non-null) will start with this prefix.
 *
 * @property {string} source  The pattern that was passed into the contructor
 *
 * @property {string} sourcePath  The path portion of the source property
 *
 * @property {string} sourceSearch  The search portion of the source property
 *
 * @property {string} regex  The constructed regex that will be used to match against the url when 
 *   it is time to determine which url will match.
 *
 * @returns {Object}  New UrlMatcher object

   * @ngdoc function
   * @name ui.router.router.$urlRouterProvider#when
   * @methodOf ui.router.router.$urlRouterProvider
   *
   * @description
   * Registers a handler for a given url matching. if handle is a string, it is
   * treated as a redirect, and is interpolated according to the syyntax of match
   * (i.e. like String.replace() for RegExp, or like a UrlMatcher pattern otherwise).
   *
   * If the handler is a function, it is injectable. It gets invoked if `$location`
   * matches. You have the option of inject the match object as `$match`.
   *
   * The handler can return
   *
   * - **falsy** to indicate that the rule didn't match after all, then `$urlRouter`
   *   will continue trying to find another one that matches.
   * - **string** which is treated as a redirect and passed to `$location.url()`
   * - **void** or any **truthy** value tells `$urlRouter` that the url was handled.
   *
   * @example
   * <pre>
   * var app = angular.module('app', ['ui.router.router']);
   *
   * app.config(function ($urlRouterProvider) {
   *   $urlRouterProvider.when($state.url, function ($match, $stateParams) {

 * The new `$stateProvider` works similar to Angular's v1 router, but it focuses purely

 * States often have things in common, and the primary way of factoring out these

  /**
   * @ngdoc function
   * @name ui.router.state.$stateProvider#decorator
   * @methodOf ui.router.state.$stateProvider
   *
   * @description
   * Allows you to extend (carefully) or override (at your own peril) the 
   * `stateBuilder` object used internally by `$stateProvider`. This can be used 
   * to add custom functionality to ui-router, for example inferring templateUrl 
   * based on the state name.
   *
   * When passing only a name, it returns the current (original or decorated) builder
   * function that matches `name`.
   *
   * The builder functions that can be decorated are listed below. Though not all
   * necessarily have a good use case for decoration, that is up to you to decide.
   *
   * In addition, users can attach custom decorators, which will generate new 
   * properties within the state's internal definition. There is currently no clear 
   * use-case for this beyond accessing internal states (i.e. $state.$current), 
   * however, expect this to become increasingly relevant as we introduce additional 
   * meta-programming features.
   *
   * **Warning**: Decorators should not be interdependent because the order of 
   * execution of the builder functions in non-deterministic. Builder functions 
   * should only be dependent on the state definition object and super function.
   *
   *
   * Existing builder functions and current return values:
   *
   * - **parent** `{object}` - returns the parent state object.
   * - **data** `{object}` - returns state data, including any inherited data that is not
   *   overridden by own values (if any).
   * - **url** `{object}` - returns a {link ui.router.util.type:UrlMatcher} or null.
   * - **navigable** `{object}` - returns closest ancestor state that has a URL (aka is 
   *   navigable).
   * - **params** `{object}` - returns an array of state params that are ensured to 
   *   be a super-set of parent's params.
   * - **views** `{object}` - returns a views object where each key is an absolute view 
   *   name (i.e. "viewName@stateName") and each value is the config object 
   *   (template, controller) for the view. Even when you don't use the views object 
   *   explicitly on a state config, one is still created for you internally.
   *   So by decorating this builder function you have access to decorating template 
   *   and controller properties.
   * - **ownParams** `{object}` - returns an array of params that belong to the state, 
   *   not including any params defined by ancestor states.
   * - **path** `{string}` - returns the full path from the root down to this state. 
   *   Needed for state activation.
   * - **includes** `{object}` - returns an object that includes every state that 
   *   would pass a '$state.includes()' test.
   *
   * @example
   * <pre>
   * // Override the internal 'views' builder with a function that takes the state
   * // definition, and a reference to the internal function being overridden:

   *       views = parent(state);
   *

   *     config.templateUrl = config.templateUrl || '/partials/' + autoName + '.html';
   *     result[name] = config;
   *   });
   *   return result;
   * });
   *

   *   related scope or the name of a registered controller if passed as a string.
   *
   * <a id='controllerProvider'></a>
   *
   * - **`controllerProvider`** - {function=} - Injectable provider function that returns
   *   the actual controller or string.
   *
   * <a id='controllerAs'></a>
   * 
   * - **`controllerAs`** – {string=} – A controller alias name. If present the controller will be 
   *   published to scope under the controllerAs name.
   *
   * <a id='resolve'></a>
   *
   * - **`resolve`** - {object.&lt;string, function&gt;=} - An optional map of dependencies which 
   *   should be injected into the controller. If any of these dependencies are promises, 
   *   the router will wait for them all to be resolved or one to be rejected before the 
   *   controller is instantiated. If all the promises are resolved successfully, the values 
   *   of the resolved promises are injected and $stateChangeSuccess event is fired. If any 
   *   of the promises are rejected the $stateChangeError event is fired. The map object is:
   *   
   *   - key - {string}: name of dependency to be injected into controller
   *   - factory - {string|function}: If string then it is alias for service. Otherwise if function, 
   *     it is injected and return value it treated as dependency. If result is a promise, it is

   * <a id='url'></a>
   *
   * - **`url`** - {string=} - A url with optional parameters. When a state is navigated or
   *   transitioned to, the `$stateParams` service will be populated with any 
   *   parameters that were passed.
   *
   * <a id='params'></a>
   *
   * - **`params`** - {object=} - An array of parameter names or regular expressions. Only 
   *   use this within a state if you are not using url. Otherwise you can specify your
   *   parameters within the url. When a state is navigated or transitioned to, the 
   *   $stateParams service will be populated with any parameters that were passed.
   *
   * <a id='views'></a>
   *
   * - **`views`** - {object=} - Use the views property to set up multiple views or to target views
   *   manually/explicitly.
   *
   * <a id='abstract'></a>
   *
   * - **`abstract`** - {boolean=} - An abstract state will never be directly activated, 
   *   but can provide inherited properties to its common children states.
   *
   * <a id='onEnter'></a>
   *
   * - **`onEnter`** - {object=} - Callback function for when a state is entered. Good way
   *   to trigger an action or dispatch an event, such as opening a dialog.
   *
   * <a id='onExit'></a>
   *
   * - **`onExit`** - {object=} - Callback function for when a state is exited. Good way to
   *   trigger an action or dispatch an event, such as opening a dialog.
   *
   * <a id='reloadOnSearch'></a>
   *
   * - **`reloadOnSearch = true`** - {boolean=} - If `false`, will not retrigger the same state 
   *   just because a search/query parameter has changed (via $location.search() or $location.hash()). 
   *   Useful for when you'd like to modify $location.search() without triggering a reload.
   *
   * <a id='data'></a>
   *
   * - **`data`** - {object=} - Arbitrary data object, useful for custom configuration.
   *
   * @example
   * <pre>
   * // Some state name examples
   *
   * // stateName can be a single top-level name (must be unique).
   * $stateProvider.state("home", {});
   *
   * // Or it can be a nested state name. This state is a child of the 
   * // above "home" state.
   * $stateProvider.state("home.newest", {});
   *
   * // Nest states as deeply as needed.
   * $stateProvider.state("home.newest.abc.xyz.inception", {});
   *
   * // state() returns $stateProvider, so you can chain state declarations.
   * $stateProvider
   *   .state("home", {})
   *   .state("about", {})
   *   .state("contacts", {});
   * </pre>
   *
   * @param {string} name A unique state name, e.g. "home", "about", "contacts".

     * @methodOf ui.router.state.$state
     *
     * @description
     * Convenience method for transitioning to a new state. `$state.go` calls 
     * `$state.transitionTo` internally but automatically sets options to 
     * `{ location: true, inherit: true, relative: $state.$current, notify: true }`. 
     * This allows you to easily use an absolute or relative to path and specify 
     * only the parameters you'd like to update (while letting unspecified parameters 
     * inherit from the currently active ancestor states).
     *
     * @example
     * <pre>
     * var app = angular.module('app', ['ui.router']);
     *
     * app.controller('ctrl', function ($scope, $state) {
     *   $scope.changeState = function () {
     *     $state.go('contact.detail');
     *   };

     * </pre>
     * <img src='../ngdoc_assets/StateGoExamples.png'/>
     *
     * @param {string} to Absolute state name or relative state path. Some examples:
     *
     * - `$state.go('contact.detail')` - will go to the `contact.detail` state
     * - `$state.go('^')` - will go to a parent state
     * - `$state.go('^.sibling')` - will go to a sibling state
     * - `$state.go('.child.grandchild')` - will go to grandchild state
     *
     * @param {object=} params A map of the parameters that will be sent to the state, 
     * will populate $stateParams. Any parameters that are not specified will be inherited from currently 
     * defined parameters. This allows, for example, going to a sibling state that shares parameters
     * specified in a parent state. Parameter inheritance only works between common ancestor states, I.e.
     * transitioning to a sibling will get you the parameters for all parents, transitioning to a child
     * will get you all current parameters, etc.
     * @param {object=} options Options object. The options are:
     *
     * - **`location`** - {boolean=true|string=} - If `true` will update the url in the location bar, if `false`
     *    will not. If string, must be `"replace"`, which will update url and also replace last history record.
     * - **`inherit`** - {boolean=true}, If `true` will inherit url parameters from current url.
     * - **`relative`** - {object=$state.$current}, When transitioning with relative path (e.g '^'), 
     *    defines which state to be relative from.
     * - **`notify`** - {boolean=true}, If `true` will broadcast $stateChangeStart and $stateChangeSuccess events.
     * - **`reload`** (v0.2.5) - {boolean=false}, If `true` will force transition even if the state or params 
     *    have not changed, aka a reload of the same state. It differs from reloadOnSearch because you'd
     *    use this when you want to force a reload when *everything* is the same, including search params.
     *
     * @returns {promise} A promise representing the state of the new transition.
     *
     * Possible success values:
     *
     * - $state.current
     *
     * <br/>Possible rejection values:
     *
     * - 'transition superseded' - when a newer transition has been started after this one
     * - 'transition prevented' - when `event.preventDefault()` has been called in a `$stateChangeStart` listener
     * - 'transition aborted' - when `event.preventDefault()` has been called in a `$stateNotFound` listener or
     *   when a `$stateNotFound` `event.retry` promise errors.
     * - 'transition failed' - when a state has been unsuccessfully found after 2 tries.
     * - *resolve error* - when an error has occurred with a `resolve`

 * @requires $document
 *
 * @restrict ECA
 *
 * @description
 * The ui-view directive tells $state where to place your templates.
 *
 * @param {string=} ui-view A view name. The name should be unique amongst the other views in the
 * same state. You can have views of the same name that live in different states.
 *
 * @param {string=} autoscroll It allows you to set the scroll behavior of the browser window
 * when a view is populated. By default, $anchorScroll is overridden by ui-router's custom scroll
 * service, {@link ui.router.state.$uiViewScroll}. This custom service let's you
 * scroll ui-view elements into view when they are populated during a state activation.
 *
 * *Note: To revert back to old [`$anchorScroll`](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$anchorScroll)
 * functionality, call `$uiViewScrollProvider.useAnchorScroll()`.*
 *
 * @param {string=} onload Expression to evaluate whenever the view updates.
 * 
 * @example
 * A view can be unnamed or named. 
 * <pre>
 * <!-- Unnamed -->
 * <div ui-view></div> 
 * 
 * <!-- Named -->
 * <div ui-view="viewName"></div>
 * </pre>
 *
 * You can only have one unnamed view within any template (or root html). If you are only using a 
 * single view and it is unnamed then you can populate it like so:
 * <pre>
 * <div ui-view></div> 
 * $stateProvider.state("home", {
 *   template: "<h1>HELLO!</h1>"
 * })
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The above is a convenient shortcut equivalent to specifying your view explicitly with the {@link ui.router.state.$stateProvider#views `views`}
 * config property, by name, in this case an empty name:
 * <pre>
 * $stateProvider.state("home", {
 *   views: {
 *     "": {
 *       template: "<h1>HELLO!</h1>"
 *     }
 *   }    
 * })
 * </pre>
 * 
 * But typically you'll only use the views property if you name your view or have more than one view 
 * in the same template. There's not really a compelling reason to name a view if its the only one, 
 * but you could if you wanted, like so:
 * <pre>
 * <div ui-view="main"></div>
 * </pre> 
 * <pre>
 * $stateProvider.state("home", {
 *   views: {
 *     "main": {
 *       template: "<h1>HELLO!</h1>"
 *     }
 *   }    
 * })
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Really though, you'll use views to set up multiple views:
 * <pre>
 * <div ui-view></div>
 * <div ui-view="chart"></div> 
 * <div ui-view="data"></div> 
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * $stateProvider.state("home", {
 *   views: {
 *     "": {
 *       template: "<h1>HELLO!</h1>"
 *     },
 *     "chart": {
 *       template: "<chart_thing/>"
 *     },
 *     "data": {
 *       template: "<data_thing/>"
 *     }
 *   }    
 * })
 * </pre>
 *
 * Examples for `autoscroll`:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <!-- If autoscroll present with no expression,
 *      then scroll ui-view into view -->
 * <ui-view autoscroll/>
 *
 * <!-- If autoscroll present with valid expression,
 *      then scroll ui-view into view if expression evaluates to true -->
 * <ui-view autoscroll='true'/>
 * <ui-view autoscroll='false'/>
 * <ui-view autoscroll='scopeVariable'/>
 * </pre>

 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ui.router.state.directive:ui-sref
 *
 * @requires ui.router.state.$state
 * @requires $timeout
 *
 * @restrict A
 *
 * @description
 * A directive that binds a link (`<a>` tag) to a state. If the state has an associated 
 * URL, the directive will automatically generate & update the `href` attribute via 
 * the {@link ui.router.state.$state#methods_href $state.href()} method. Clicking 
 * the link will trigger a state transition with optional parameters. 
 *
 * Also middle-clicking, right-clicking, and ctrl-clicking on the link will be 
 * handled natively by the browser.
 *
 * You can also use relative state paths within ui-sref, just like the relative 
 * paths passed to `$state.go()`. You just need to be aware that the path is relative
 * to the state that the link lives in, in other words the state that loaded the 
 * template containing the link.
 *
 * You can specify options to pass to {@link ui.router.state.$state#go $state.go()}
 * using the `ui-sref-opts` attribute. Options are restricted to `location`, `inherit`,
 * and `reload`.
 *
 * @example
 * Here's an example of how you'd use ui-sref and how it would compile. If you have the 
 * following template:
 * <pre>
 * <a ui-sref="home">Home</a> | <a ui-sref="about">About</a>
 * 
 * <ul>
 *     <li ng-repeat="contact in contacts">
 *         <a ui-sref="contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })">{{ contact.name }}</a>
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Then the compiled html would be (assuming Html5Mode is off):
 * <pre>
 * <a href="#/home" ui-sref="home">Home</a> | <a href="#/about" ui-sref="about">About</a>
 * 
 * <ul>
 *     <li ng-repeat="contact in contacts">
 *         <a href="#/contacts/1" ui-sref="contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })">Joe</a>
 *     </li>
 *     <li ng-repeat="contact in contacts">
 *         <a href="#/contacts/2" ui-sref="contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })">Alice</a>
 *     </li>
 *     <li ng-repeat="contact in contacts">
 *         <a href="#/contacts/3" ui-sref="contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })">Bob</a>
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <a ui-sref="home" ui-sref-opts="{reload: true}">Home</a>
 * </pre>

 * @param {string} ui-sref 'stateName' can be any valid absolute or relative state
 * @param {Object} ui-sref-opts options to pass to {@link ui.router.state.$state#go $state.go()}

 * @requires $interpolate
 *
 * @restrict A
 *
 * @description
 * A directive working alongside ui-sref to add classes to an element when the 
 * related ui-sref directive's state is active, and removing them when it is inactive.
 * The primary use-case is to simplify the special appearance of navigation menus 
 * relying on `ui-sref`, by having the "active" state's menu button appear different,
 * distinguishing it from the inactive menu items.
 *
 * @example
 * Given the following template:
 * <pre>
 * <ul>
 *   <li ui-sref-active="active" class="item">
 *     <a href ui-sref="app.user({user: 'bilbobaggins'})">@bilbobaggins</a>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * When the app state is "app.user", and contains the state parameter "user" with value "bilbobaggins", 
 * the resulting HTML will appear as (note the 'active' class):
 * <pre>
 * <ul>
 *   <li ui-sref-active="active" class="item active">
 *     <a ui-sref="app.user({user: 'bilbobaggins'})" href="/users/bilbobaggins">@bilbobaggins</a>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The class name is interpolated **once** during the directives link time (any further changes to the 
 * interpolated value are ignored). 
 * 
 * Multiple classes may be specified in a space-separated format:
 * <pre>
 * <ul>
 *   <li ui-sref-active='class1 class2 class3'>
 *     <a ui-sref="app.user">link</a>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>

     * `concat`, `join`, `pop`, `push`, `reverse`, `shift`, `slice`, `sort`, `splice`,

     *
     * Chaining is supported in custom builds as long as the `value` method is

     * `after`, `assign`, `bind`, `bindAll`, `bindKey`, `chain`, `compact`,
     * `compose`, `concat`, `countBy`, `create`, `createCallback`, `curry`,
     * `debounce`, `defaults`, `defer`, `delay`, `difference`, `filter`, `flatten`,
     * `forEach`, `forEachRight`, `forIn`, `forInRight`, `forOwn`, `forOwnRight`,

     * `invoke`, `keys`, `map`, `max`, `memoize`, `merge`, `min`, `object`, `omit`,

     * `union`, `uniq`, `unshift`, `unzip`, `values`, `where`, `without`, `wrap`,
     * and `zip`
     *
     * The non-chainable wrapper functions are:
     * `clone`, `cloneDeep`, `contains`, `escape`, `every`, `find`, `findIndex`,
     * `findKey`, `findLast`, `findLastIndex`, `findLastKey`, `has`, `identity`,
     * `indexOf`, `isArguments`, `isArray`, `isBoolean`, `isDate`, `isElement`,
     * `isEmpty`, `isEqual`, `isFinite`, `isFunction`, `isNaN`, `isNull`, `isNumber`,

 * will be created if necessary. All three have bi-directional association,
 * i.e.  drag or zoom the map and they will update, update them and the map
 * will change.  However, any initial state of these three variables will be
 * ignored.
 *
 * If you need to get a handle on the google.maps.Map object, see
 * {@link angulargm.service:angulargmContainer angulargmContainer}
 *
 * @param {expression} gm-map-id angular expression that evaluates to a unique
 * string id for the map, e.g. `'map_canvas'` or `myMapId` where myMapId is a
 * variable in the current scope. This allows you to have multiple
 * maps/instances of the directive.
 *
 *
 * @param {expression} gm-center center variable in the current scope.  The
 * value will be a google.maps.LatLng object.
 *
 *
 * @param {expression} gm-zoom zoom variable in the current scope.  Value will
 * be an integer.
 *
 *
 * @param {expression} gm-bounds bounds variable in the current scope.  Value
 * will be a google.maps.LatLngBounds object.
 *
 *
 * @param {expression} gm-map-type-id mapTypeId variable in the current scope.
 * Value will be a string.
 *
 *
 * @param {expression} gm-map-options object in the current scope that is a
 * google.maps.MapOptions object. If unspecified, will use the values in
 * angulargmDefaults.mapOptions. {@link angulargm.service:angulargmDefaults angulargmDefaults} is a service, so it is
 * both injectable and overrideable (using $provide.decorator).
 *
 * @param {expression} gm-on-*event* an angular expression which evaluates to
 * an event handler. This handler will be attached to each marker's \*event\*
 * event.  The variables 'map' and 'event' evaluate to the map and the
 * [google.maps.MouseEvent](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#MouseEvent),
 * respectively. The map is always passed in, but the MouseEvent is only passed in if the event emits it.  For example:
 * ```html
 * gm-on-click="myClickFn(map, event)"
 * ```
 * will call your `myClickFn` whenever the map is clicked.  You may have
 * multiple `gm-on-*event*` handlers, but only one for each type of event.  For events that have an underscore in their

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name angulargm.directive:gmMarkers
 * @element ANY
 *
 * @description
 * A directive for adding markers to a `gmMap`. You may have multiple per `gmMap`.
 *
 * To use, you specify an array of custom objects and tell the directive how to
 * extract an id and position from them. A marker will be created for each of
 * your objects. If you assign a new array to your scope variable or change the
 * array's length (i.e. add or remove an object), the markers will also update.
 * The one case where `gmMarkers` can not automatically detect changes to your
 * objects is when you mutate objects in the array. To inform the directive of
 * such changes, see the `gmMarkersUpdate` event below.
 *
 * Only the `gm-objects`, `gm-id` and `gm-position` attributes are required.
 *
 * @param {expression} gm-objects an array of objects in the current scope.
 * These can be any objects you wish to attach to markers, the only requirement
 * is that they have a uniform method of accessing an id and a position.
 *
 * @param {expression} gm-id an angular expression that given an object from
 * `gm-objects`, evaluates to a unique identifier for that object. Your object
 * can be accessed through the variable `object`. See `gm-position` below for
 * an example.
 *
 * @param {expression} gm-position an angular expression that given an object from
 * `gm-objects`, evaluates to an object with lat and lng properties. Your
 * object can be accessed through the variable `object`.  For example, if
 * your controller has
 * ```js
 * ...
 * $scope.myObjects = [
 *   { id: 0, location: { lat: 5, lng: 5} }, 
 *   { id: 1, location: { lat: 6, lng: 6} }
 * ]
 * ...
 * ```
 * then in the `gm-markers` directive you would put
 * ```js
 * ...
 * gm-objects="myObjects"
 * gm-id="object.id"
 * gm-position="{ lat: object.location.lat, lng: object.location.lng }"
 * ...
 * ```
 *
 *
 * @param {expression} gm-marker-options an angular expression that given
 * an object from `gm-objects`, evaluates to a
 * [google.maps.MarkerOptions](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#MarkerOptions)
 * object.  Your object can be accessed through the variable `object`. If
 * unspecified, google maps api defaults will be used.
 *
 *
 * @param {expression} gm-events a variable in the current scope that is used to
 * simulate events on markers. Setting this variable to an object of the form 
 * ```js
 *     [
 *       {
 *         event: 'click',
 *         ids: [id1, ...]
 *       },
 *       ...
 *     ]
 * ```
 * will generate the named events on the markers with the given ids, if a
 * marker with each id exists. Note: when setting the `gm-events` variable, you
 * must set it to a new object for the changes to be detected.  Code like
 * ```js
 * myEvents[0]["ids"] = [0]
 * ``` 
 * will not work.
 *                      
 *
 * @param {expression} gm-on-*event* an angular expression which evaluates to
 * an event handler. This handler will be attached to each marker's \*event\*
 * event.  The variables 'object' and 'marker' evaluate to your object and the
 * [google.maps.Marker](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#Marker),
 * respectively. For example: 
 * ```html
 * gm-on-click="myClickFn(object, marker)"
 * ```
 * will call your `myClickFn` whenever a marker is clicked.  You may have
 * multiple `gm-on-*event*` handlers, but only one for each type of event.
 * For events that have an underscore in their name, such as
 * 'position_changed', write it as 'gm-on-position-changed'.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name angulargm.directive:gmPolylines
 * @element ANY
 *
 * @description
 * A directive for adding polylines to a `gmMap`. You may have multiple per `gmMap`.
 *
 * To use, you specify an array of custom objects and tell the directive how to
 * extract location data from them. A polyline will be created for each of your
 * objects. If you assign a new array to your scope variable or change the
 * array's length, the polylines will also update.  The one case where
 * `gmPolylines` can not automatically detect changes to your objects is when
 * you mutate objects in the array. To inform the directive of such changes,
 * see the `gmPolylinesUpdate` event below.
 *
 * Only the `gm-objects`, `gm-id` and `gm-path` attributes are required.
 *
 * @param {expression} gm-objects an array of objects in the current scope.
 * These can be any objects you wish to attach to polylines, the only requirement
 * is that they have a uniform method of accessing an id and a path.
 *
 * @param {expression} gm-path an angular expression that given an object
 * from `gm-objects`, evaluates to an array of objects with lat and lng
 * properties. Your object can be accessed through the variable `object`.  For
 * example, if your controller has
 * ```js
 * ...
 * $scope.myObjects = [
 *   { id: 0, path: [ { lat: 5, lng: 5}, {lat: 4, lng: 4} ]},
 *   { id: 1, path: [ { lat: 6, lng: 6}, {lat: 7, lng: 7} ]}
 * ]
 * ...
 * ```
 * then in the `gm-polylines` directive you would put
 * ```js
 * ...
 * gm-objects="myObjects"
 * gm-get-path="object.path"
 * ...
 * ```
 *
 * @param {expression} gm-polyline-options an angular expression that given
 * an object from `gm-objects`, evaluates to a
 * [google.maps.PolylineOptions](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#PolylineOptions)
 * object.  Your object can be accessed through the variable `object`. If
 * unspecified, google maps api defaults will be used.
 *
 * @param {expression} gm-events a variable in the current scope that is used to
 * simulate events on polylines. Setting this variable to an object of the form 
 * ```js
 *     [
 *       {
 *         event: 'click',
 *         ids: [id1, ...]
 *       },
 *       ...
 *     ]
 * ```
 * will generate the named events on the polylines with the given ids, if a
 * polyline with each id exists. Note: when setting the `gm-events` variable, you
 * must set it to a new object for the changes to be detected.  Code like
 * ```js
 * myEvents[0]["ids"] = [0]
 * ``` 
 * will not work.
 *                      
 *
 * @param {expression} gm-on-*event* an angular expression which evaluates to
 * an event handler. This handler will be attached to each polyline's \*event\*
 * event.  The variables 'object' and 'polyline' evaluate to your object and the
 * [google.maps.Polyline](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#Polyline),
 * respectively. For example: 
 * ```html
 * gm-on-click="myClickFn(object, polyline)"
 * ```
 * will call your `myClickFn` whenever a polyline is clicked.  You may have
 * multiple `gm-on-*event*` handlers, but only one for each type of event.
 * For events that have an underscore in their name, such as
 * 'position_changed', write it as 'gm-on-position-changed'.
